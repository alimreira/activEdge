The Stockentity class contains relevant fields necessary for storing values. 

In the controller class, Rest Services were created for the stock Entity. 
This will enable users perform CRUD 
(Create, Read, Update, Delete) stock activities when requests are sent to the
required endpoints.


The server listens for requests on localhost:8080/api
