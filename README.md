The Stockentity class contains relevant fields necessary for storing values. 

In the controller class, Rest Services were created for the stock Entity. 
This will enable users perform CRUD 
(Create, Read, Update, Delete) stock activities when requests are sent to the
required endpoints.



To start the application, clone the repository and cd into the containing folder

run ./mvnw clean verify to build the application

run java -jar target/*.jar to start the jar file

The server listens for requests on localhost:8080/api
